# Welcome to my humble attempt at a Tetris Clone in Python!

## Using: 
-Python version: python 3.12.3

-Pygame version 2.5.2

### Goals
As a new programmer I am determined to learn as much as possible. I chose to model Tetris as I believed it would fine tune my basic abilities of class structure while learning how to not rely solely on inheritance to achieve DRY code. These goals will update as I continue with the project.
1. How to use Pygame
2. Corret use of inheritance
